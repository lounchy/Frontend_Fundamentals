    <!--List of Preparation steps-->
    <h3>Preparation:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oil in a pan and fry the onion and garlic over a low to medium heat for 4–5 minutes, or until
            softened. </li>
        <li>Mix the chilli powder, turmeric and salt together in a bowl until well combined, then add the chicken
            pieces and mix well to coat. Add the coated chicken to the pan and fry for 10–15 minutes, or until
            golden-brown and cooked through.</li>
        <li>Stir the tomatoes, ginger, cumin and coriander into the pan, then reduce the heat until the mixture is just
            simmering. Cover the pan with a lid and cook for 20–30 minutes, stirring occasionally and adding a
            tablespoon of water every so often if the mixture appears too dry. </li>
        <li>Stir in the butter and add the lemon juice, to taste. </li>
        <li>To serve, spoon the chicken jalfrezi onto serving plates. Serve with rice, naan and lime wedges on the
            side, then garnish with the chopped coriander and sliced red chillies.</li>
