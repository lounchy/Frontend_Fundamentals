    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oil in a pan and fry the onion and garlic over a low to medium heat for 4–5 minutes, or until
            softened.  <img src="emoji/smile.png"></li>
        <li>Mix the chilli powder, turmeric and salt together in a bowl until well combined, then add the chicken
            pieces and mix well to coat. Add the coated chicken to the pan and fry for 10–15 minutes, or until
            golden-brown and cooked through.<img src="emoji/hug.png"></li>
        <li>Stir the tomatoes, ginger, cumin and coriander into the pan, then reduce the heat until the mixture is just
            simmering. Cover the pan with a lid and cook for 20–30 minutes, stirring occasionally and adding a
            tablespoon of water every so often if the mixture appears too dry. <img src="emoji/thinking.png"></li>
        <li>Stir in the butter and add the lemon juice, to taste. <img src="emoji/raised_eyebrow.png"></li>
        <li>To serve, spoon the chicken jalfrezi onto serving plates. Serve with rice, naan and lime wedges on the
            side, then garnish with the chopped coriander and sliced red chillies.<img src="emoji/tongue.png"></li>

    <p><i>This dish is lighter and less complex than most curries, but with caramelized aromatics and spices like Nigella and Star Anise, this Chicken Jalfrezi has a unique flavor profile that’s a far-cry from bland. Nigella seeds known in Hindi as Kalonji, are often mislabeled black caraway, black cumin or black onion seeds. While they do have an anise-like flavor with hints of onion, Nigella Sativa is totally unrelated to caraway, cumin or onion with its closest, though still distant relative being Poppies.</i></p>
